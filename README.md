# C-red-black-tree
This is my attempt at implementing a Red-Black tree in C.
To keep things simple, multiple nodes of same values cant be made.
The sole purpose of this project was for me to expand my DSA knowledge, while having some "fun" in C.

# I advise to not learn from this code

if you find anything wrong, let me know!
I am not even sure it fully works!

I dreamed nightmares about this project for a week
